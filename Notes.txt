1. npm init will intialize the npm application with default package.json and create src folder under root
2. npm i -D webpack webpack-cli, these dependecies are used for webpack bundling the project.
3. add "build": "webpack --mode production" in package.json scripts section. When we run
npm run build, webpack  bundles the js files into dist folder.

4. add index.js with alert("Hello World") under src folder

run npm run build : will see the dist folder with index.js files

5. inordere to run above js  file, we need html file so we need to install html-webpack-plugin

6. html-webpack-plugin bundles the html file and add our index.js file to build folder

7. for that purpose, we need webapck.config.js file

  const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require('HtmlWebPackPlugin');

  module.exports = {
      plugins: [
          template: "./src/index.html" // main index.html file
          filename: "index.html" // this plugin adds the index.html file in dist folder with index.js file in dist folder
      ]

  };

8. we need to add webpack-dev-server dev depenedency for pick up changes dynamically and run webapck server wehn development

9. npm i -D webpack-dev-server
10. add this command under scripts in package.json

   "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode --open development"
